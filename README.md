# Imposter-Game-Phyton

This game is not meant to be played only in terminal, To play this game you need some real people Not ChatGPT!!

To play "Imposter Game" you need to Run the code in the app for Phyton (I recommend using "Visual Studio Code")

This Game is made to run in terminal Not a Visual interface!!! So don't try to find Visual interface!!

How to play "Imposter Game":
In this game, players are assigned roles of either "IMPOSTER" or "Innocent" Players with the "Innocent" role receive a secret word, while "IMPOSTER" players must guess it. The game continues until Players decide to reveal the roles and the secret word


If you want more WORDS and/or you want to change WORDS then in code you need to find 84 line of code and edit them.

Enjoy playing! :>
